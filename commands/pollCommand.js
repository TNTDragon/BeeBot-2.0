    ===============================================================
    If you'd wish to change the description of a command,
    or where it can be executed, here is where you do that.

    By default all this command is allowed in whatever pollChannelID
    is set to, which is also where the polls are posted, but if you
    wish to keep the poll channel for polls only, change the
    allowedChannels: [config.settings.pollChannelID],
    line, seen below, into:
    allowedChannels: ["CHANNEL ID"],
    replacing CHANNEL ID with the number ID of the channel


    Please note that description and usage is only visible in -help,
    and actual command name has to be changed via commands.js
