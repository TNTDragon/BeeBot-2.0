/*  Information on the command as a whole
Just as with -stats, this command is mostly Hardcoded.
The reasoning is similar: I believe it's better to code
in whatever stats you think are worth comparing, rather
than rely on same lists for each of so different games

But if you believe something has to be added, I suggest
messaging me. You can try adding the code in yourself,
however messaging me may make the updated comparison
available to everyone with the next update.
