This is the public BeeBot 2.0 GitHub Repository. For help or feature requests, contact me on Discord or use the forum link (both at the bottom)\n
BeeBot is a Discord Bot, which provides an easy and clean access to stats from the "The Hive" Minecraft server. The bot was originally made by Maxthat, but is currently maintained and updated by TNT Dragon and Caphaldor.\n
The bot can provide:\n
• Player statistics for all Hive gamemodes\n
• Comparison of stats between players\n
• A list of speedrunning records for any player\n
• Information on a players Block Levels\n
• Information on a specific player\n
• Swear Filter\n
• Bot control commands.
\n\n
As the bot is constantly under development, there are many more commands that will come in the future!\n
The bot has a settings area in the config.json file under the code directory. Don't forget to put your Server ID and Log Channel ID there when you set up the bot, and set the rest as you please
